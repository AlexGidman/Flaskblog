Flask app building exercise - blog website

- My initial attempt to build a basic flask application. The SQL implementation is very primitve, and at some poiny will be updated to use SLQ-Alchemy & Models. 
- This project includes a simple REST API to show current time at users designated location according to their profile info. 
- Some experimentation with using a blueprint for the user profile section.
